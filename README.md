This repository contains all the [HackerRank challenges that I have either completed or am currently working on](https://www.hackerrank.com/jenjnif "my HackerRank profile") and also includes the programmes I have written to learn more about the challenges. These challenges are good practice for my development, for interview tests and also really fun!
